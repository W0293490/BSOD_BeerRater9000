r1, r2 (registration password variables)
r1 = plaintext, register password
r2 = hashed r1, pushed to database
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
l1, l2 (logging in password variables)
l1 = plaintext, login password
l2 = hashed l1, compare with r2 // User.password.r2 where Register username and login username match
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Current problem:
All hash are the same for every user after the first(?)

Potential solutions:
Clear variables after registering/logging in

The comparison for signing in is not strict enough?: 
					[ Login username -> username in database ]
					[ Login password -> username password in database ]
					
After writing a new user (register), clear all used variables since if successful, the hashed password will be in the database.

Create a variable for data[currentUser].password when trying to login to compare IF logging in username matches with a database username value
